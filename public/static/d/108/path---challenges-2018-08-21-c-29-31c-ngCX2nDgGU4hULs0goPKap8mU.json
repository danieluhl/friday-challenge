{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Description</h2>\n<pre><code>These birds can get competitive at times, and when it comes to racing no stage\nis bigger and no spotlight brighter than the üèÅ Wayfair Fowl 500 üèÅ.\n\nThey are obsessive not just about who is the fastest but also about just how fast\nthey actually are. Problem is no one has a stopwatch, so we'll need to make\nsomething for them.\n\nBASIC REQUIREMENTS:\n- make a custom hook called \"useStopwatch\" using the shell API given in customHooks.js\n- implement a stopwatch in the app. It should:\n    - display the running time in seconds to the nearest tenth, e.g. 10.2s\n    - have \"start\", \"stop\", and \"reset\" functionality\n\nNote: feel free to modify the markup and styling ANY way you want to!\n\n\nEXTRA REQUIREMENTS if you are feeling good about your stopwatch:\n- use the hook you made to power two stopwatches on this page\n- enable a \"Start All\" button that starts both stopwatches at the same time\n  and a \"Reset All\" button that stops and resets both to 0\n- each stopwatch should have its own \"lap\" button that marks the lap time.\n- lap times should be displayed under the running time in the format of your choice, e.g. 10.2 - 15.3 - 22.0\n\n\nSUPER BONUS:\n- add the ability to have an arbitrary number of stopwatches on the page!\n</code></pre>\n<iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/vr4k32nky\" style=\"width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\" sandbox=\"allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/vr4k32nky\">https://codesandbox.io/s/vr4k32nky</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Wayfair Fowl 500 (hooks)"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/challenges/2018-08-21/"}}
