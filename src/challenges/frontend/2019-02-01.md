The birds in Chicago hate the cold but they found the secret to staying warm: laughter! Unfortunately, birds have a terrible sense of humor and only laugh at the worst jokes.

CHALLENGE: Design and deploy a website with one button that shows a random dad joke. Your button must be deployed to a new production website (we recommend now.sh or netlify.com). When pressed, use the dad joke api to show a random joke https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api

Good luck and stay warm!

## Winning Solution

Hope everyone enjoyed that one. This one is tough to judge but since itâ€™s entirely subjective and up to me I gotta go with the amazing UX/UI @jmitchell3 put together.. nice work! http://dad-joke.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
